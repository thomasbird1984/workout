## <a name="getting-started"/>Getting Started

1.  Install [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), if not already installed.
1.  Activate WebStorm by launching the application and [logging in with your JetBrains credentials](https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb/articles/208459025-Using-your-JetBrains-Account-to-activate-JetBrains-software).
1.  Install the `SonarLint` WebStorm plugin by going to `Preferences / Plugins / Browse Repositories`, searching for
    "sonar" and installing from the results.
1.  [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Running `git --version` from a command
    line on a Mac will prompt you to install it via Xcode Tools.
1.  [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 6+ (LTS - Long Term Support).
1.  Clone this repository into the directory `/Users/[username]/Development/PDS/`.
1.  Set up the project's Git hooks by running `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` in the project directory. ([README](.githooks/README.md))
1.  Run `npm npm-install` ([npm-install script](docs/npm-scripts.md#npm-install)) from `/Users/[username]/Development/PDS/web-app/`.
1.  Run `npm start` ([start script](docs/npm-scripts.md#start)) from `/Users/[username]/Development/PDS/web-app/` to
    create a local dev server.
1.  The app will launch in the system default browser at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).
1.  Make edits, and the app will automatically update via HMR (Hot Module Reloading) on your local dev server.

### TypeScript

You may need to turn on TypeScript support.

Go to `Preferences / Languages & Frameworks / TypeScript` and make sure "TypeScript Language Service" is checked.

### White Space

You can turn on a useful white space setting that will remove all trailing spaces on each line when a file is saved.

Go to `Preferences / Editor / General` and under the "Other" section, turn off "Always keep trailing spaces on caret
line" and set "Strip trailing spaces on Save" to "All".

    user-specific customizations from being checked in.
-   **\_\_mocks\_\_/** - File/module mocks used by Jest for unit testing.

    be served to the web app.

## <a name="code-validation"/>Code Validation

The following items will need to be completed/passing before committing any code and making a pull request. You can
perform all the following steps individually or you can run the [precommit](docs/npm-scripts.md#precommit)
script to run all three at once.

### Compiling

To quickly compile the project, run the [compile](docs/npm-scripts.md#compile) script.
Fix any compiler errors at this time.

### Linting

To quickly run lint, run the [lint](docs/npm-scripts.md#lint) script. Some issues can be automatically fixed by running
[lint-fix](docs/npm-scripts.md#lint-fix).

### Unit Tests

Run [test](docs/npm-scripts.md#test) and ensure all unit tests are passing.

## <a name="bem"/>BEM Methodology for CSS

BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach to CSS styling. The idea behind it is to divide the
user interface into independently styled blocks. The official [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/)
website has a good introduction to the concepts.

NOTE: For this project, the [modified naming convention](http://getbem.com/naming/) is being used.

[Example of BEM in SASS](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qoJqwz), and for reference: [The SASS Ampersand](https://css-tricks.com/the-sass-ampersand/).

## <a name="gotchas"/>Gotchas

This section contains miscellaneous things to look out for.

### Updating NPM Dependencies

When merging and/or checking out changes from another branch you will need to ensure that you run the
[npm-install](docs/npm-scripts.md#npm-install) script to install any dependencies you might not have in your branch.
If there are still issues present after running npm-install, you can try running
[npm-reinstall](docs/npm-scripts.md#npm-reinstall) to perform a complete fresh reinstall of all dependencies.
